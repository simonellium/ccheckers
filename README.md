Chinese Checker Game

I wrote this game as a port of the Chinese Checker Solitaire game my fiancee plays in real life. There was a lack of football on TV one Saturday afternoon, so I wrote this while she flipped through bridal gown magazines.

The game is written in javascript, powered by the Raphael SVG library.

The tabular layout is stolen from an elated article.
